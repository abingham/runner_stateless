Move traffic_light.colour into its own service called from web.
-------------------------------------------------
incoming files is currently
{
  'hiker.c' => {
    'content' => '#include',
    'truncated' => false
  }
}
Drop the truncation and just send in the content directly.
As per the current README.md file.
-------------------------------------------------
Also document in the README.md file truncation in the
returned files [created,changed,deleted] and [stdout,stderr].
-------------------------------------------------
Possibly make max_file_size as incoming parameter?
