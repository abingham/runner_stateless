On the tar-file-with-no-zipping branch
there was a client test failing.
It failed because there was no tar-file compression (at the time)
and files tar-piped OUT of the container are not size-limited.
They should be?
How?

One option is to simply add the option [-size -25K]
to the find all in runner.rb
See the end of ECHO_TEXT_FILENAMES
This will simply not return text files bigger than 25K

Another option is to truncate large text files to 25K (say)
before they are added to the tar file.
This could be done in the is_text_file() bash function at
the start of ECHO_TEXT_FILENAMES.
More work will be needed to set the file['truncated'] value.

o) How to get the size of each file?
   if [ $(stat -c%s "${1}") -gt #{MAX_FILE_SIZE} ]; then \
     Alpine. ok
     Ubuntu. ok
     Debian. ok
o) How to truncate it when it too large?
  truncate -s #{MAX_FILE_SIZE} "${1}"
     Alpine. ok
     Ubuntu. ok
     Debian. ok
