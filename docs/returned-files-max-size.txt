On the tar-file-with-no-zipping branch
there was a client test failing.
It failed because there was no tar-file compression (at the time)
and files tar-piped OUT of the container are not size-limited.
They should be?
How?

the create_text_file_tar_list.sh could
o) get the size of each file
   how?
   stat -c%s "${filename}"
     Alpine. ok
     Ubuntu. ok
     Debian. ok
o) if it is too large...
   - truncate the file
     how?
     truncate -s ${SIZE} "${filename}"
       Alpine. ok
       Ubuntu. ok
       Debian. ok
   - add the filename to a 2nd file holding truncated filenames
     This 2nd file would be added to the 1st list...


Then once the files have been read tar-piped back from the
container into the host process, the 2nd file could be
used to set the correct truncation values.

However, the tar-file is now compressed so there is less need
to truncate it before the tar-piping.
And the ulimits should limit the maximum size of an individual file.
