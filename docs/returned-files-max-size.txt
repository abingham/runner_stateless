On the tar-file-with-no-zipping branch
there is a client test failing.
I'm guessing this this is because files tar-piped
OUT of the container are not size-limited.
They should be.
How?
the create_text_file_tar_list.sh could get the size of
each file and if it is too large it would
o) truncated the file
o) add the filename to a 2nd file holding truncated filenames
This 2nd file would be added to the 1st list...

Then once the files have been read tar-piped back from the
container into the host process, the 2nd file could be
used to set the correct truncation values.
